# login-with-Flask
Log in form, for more information go to README

This is an exercise that I did on my Python / Flask course.

The first page invites a second page where you type email and password. If you have the right email  address and right password you are granted access. Otherwise, you will be directed to the “ Denied Access” page.  

For more information about how I overcame the challenges of the simple exercise, have a look at the “ flask-secrets-DOCUMENT.txt “ file.
