INFORMACION REFERENTE A ESTE PROYECTO: FROM: https://teamtreehouse.com/community/attributeerror-registerform-object-has-no-attribute-validateonsubmit
AttributeError: 'RegisterForm' object has no attribute 'validate_on_submit'
It seems that the 'validate_on_submit' method is no longer available for flask_wtf.Form, 
if you try to run the downloadable project you get a:

''' File "C:\python_projects\socialapp\app.py", line 42, in register if 
form.validate_on_submit(): AttributeError: 'RegisterForm' object has no attribute 'validate_on_submit' '''

after a quick stackoverflow search I swapped out the Form with a flask_wtf.FlaskForm, this runs the script,
 however then validation seems to be working incorrectly.

This is now becoming a recurring theme with teamtreehouse, that I get stuck on a Python courses due to the 
course material being out-of-date (the same with 'Flask REST API' course:
https://teamtreehouse.com/community/jsonwebsignatureserializer-depricated-from-itsdangerous-use-authlib-instead).

Could you please revisit the course material if it at least still works?

I understand that it is quite frustrating. I would end up redoing some of the videos too, especially 
this one! (I wish I could, but I am only a moderator.)

There is a definite "shelf-life" that a video has. This was cutting edge in 2017 or so, but the
 Flask-WTF major version changed in 2021 and 2022 so it no longer reflects what it was in 2017.

The only way to "play along" with the video is to pip install flask-wtf==0.14.3 but that causes
 other issues as well. Then there's Flask itself. Flask is a couple of versions newer too! So 
 you are getting a real Flask education!
 ______________________________
 After install Flask that is working with this version those modules must be installed as well :
 pip install Werkzeug==2.0.0
After that it is likely that you will also have an AttributeError related to the jinja package, so if you have it, run:

pip install jinja2==3.0.3

Super Blocks
 ***Jinja2â€™s super() function. This gives you the option of amending blocks instead of replacing them. *****
When we inherit from Python classes, you often see super.init()
When we are inheriting templates. Sometimes, there's some part of the template that we want to keep,
but we also want to add to it. So we can use super blocks in this case.
IN BASE.HTML
<style>
{% block styling %} (STYLING IS JUST A REFERENCE CAN BE ANY NAME AS LONG IN THE  ACROSS ALL THE TEMPLATE ARE THE SAME

BOOTSTRAP IN FLASK
 1. Install Flask-Bootstrap to your project using pip:

pip install Flask-Bootstrap

**********Flask-Bootstrap documentation :  https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html ***************

$$$$ CREATING FORM WITH BOOTSTRAP $$$$$$$
 
 One of the main reasons why we're using Flask-Bootstrap in this project is because it has one of the most 
 convenient methods for generating forms with WTForms.

Literally, in 1 line of code, you can create your form. It's as simple as:

{{ wtf.quick_form(form) }}

What this line of code will do is generate all the labels, inputs, buttons, styling for your form just by
 taking the WTForm object that was passed to the template (form).

You can simply delete the entire

element and add a line to inherit the wtf support from bootstrap and use the quick_form() to generate your form.
IN " LOGIN.HTML "
{% extends "bootstrap/base.html" %}
{% import "bootstrap/wtf.html" as wtf %}

{{ wtf.quick_form(form, action='login', method="post",novalidate=True) }}

LOOK AT " LOGIN.HTML " FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION ( https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/forms.html )
